**Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom Sector)**

A machine learning project that predicts whether a telecom customer will stay or leave (churn). Built using real-world data, it covers the entire ML pipeline â€” from data preprocessing and model tuning to evaluation and dashboard visualization.

**Overview**

Telecom companies lose significant revenue due to customer churn. This project identifies high-risk customers using classification models so that retention strategies can be applied proactively.

**Key Highlights**

Complete ML workflow: data cleaning, encoding, and feature engineering

Class imbalance handled with SMOTE and undersampling

Compared models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost

Optimized with GridSearchCV for best performance

Evaluated using Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Interactive Plotly dashboard for results and churn insights

**Tech Stack**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Dataset**
