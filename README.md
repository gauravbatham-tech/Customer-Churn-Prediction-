**Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom Sector)**

This project predicts whether a customer will stay or leave (churn) using machine learning. Itâ€™s built on real-world telecom data and includes a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization through an interactive dashboard.

**ðŸ”¹ Project Overview**

Customer churn is a major issue for telecom companies. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict churn based on customer behavior and service patterns, helping companies take early action to retain customers.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Features**

Data cleaning, encoding, and feature selection

Class imbalance handling using SMOTE and undersampling

Model comparison (Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost)

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Model evaluation using Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Interactive Plotly dashboard for visual analysis

Well-commented and clean notebook structure

**ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack**

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Environment: Google Colab

**ðŸ”¹ Dataset**

**ðŸ”¹ Results**

Achieved high prediction accuracy with tuned XGBoost model

Identified key factors influencing churn such as contract type, tenure, and payment method

Visual dashboard provides quick insights into model performance and churn trends

**ðŸ”¹ How to Run**

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies if needed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn plotly
